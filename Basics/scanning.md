#Overview

  * Scans are run with the Checkov [CLI](doc:cli-command-reference_clone) which can be executed manually or via script. 
  
  * See an example for checking credential security [here](doc:example-credential-scan).
   
  * When you run a scan you can also choose to ignore certain scenarios; see [Suppress/Skip](doc:suppress)
